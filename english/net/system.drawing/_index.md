The Drawing namespace provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality. More advanced functionality is provided in the Drawing2D, Imaging, and Text namespaces.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bitmap](./bitmap/) | Encapsulates a bitmap, which consists of the pixel data for a graphics image and its attributes. A [`Bitmap`](../system.drawing/bitmap/) is an object used to work with images defined by pixel data. |
| [Brush](./brush/) | Defines objects used to fill the interiors of graphical shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths. |
| [Brushes](./brushes/) | Brushes for all the standard colors. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [ColorConverter](./colorconverter/) | Converts colors from one data type to another. |
| [ColorTranslator](./colortranslator/) | Translates colors to and from GDI+ Color structures. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [DrawingSettings](./drawingsettings/) | Allows to adjust the behavior of the drawing library in case of using of some features that are not yet implemented completely. |
| [Font](./font/) | Defines a particular format for text, including font face, size, and style attributes. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [FontFamily](./fontfamily/) | Defines a group of type faces having a similar basic design and certain variations in styles. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Graphics](./graphics/) | Encapsulates drawing surface. |
| [Icon](./icon/) | Represents a Windows icon, which is a small bitmap image that is used to represent an object. Icons can be thought of as transparent bitmaps, although their size is determined by the system. |
| [Image](./image/) | An abstract base class that provides functionality for the Bitmap and Metafile descended classes. |
| [Pen](./pen/) | Defines an object used to draw lines and curves. |
| [Pens](./pens/) | Pens for all the standard colors. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Region](./region/) | Describes the interior of a graphics shape composed of rectangles and paths. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [SolidBrush](./solidbrush/) | Defines a brush of a single color. Brushes are used to fill graphics shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths. |
| [StringFormat](./stringformat/) | Encapsulates text layout information (such as alignment, orientation and tab stops) display manipulations (such as ellipsis insertion and national digit substitution) and OpenType features. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [SystemColors](./systemcolors/) | Each property of the SystemColors class is a Color structure that is the color of a Windows display element. |
| [SystemFonts](./systemfonts/) | Specifies the fonts used to display text in Windows display elements. |
| [SystemIcons](./systemicons/) | Each property of the SystemIcons class is an Icon object for Windows system-wide icons. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [TextureBrush](./texturebrush/) | Each property of the TextureBrush class is a Brush object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited. |
## Structures

| Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CharacterRange](./characterrange/) | Specifies a range of character positions within a string. |
| [Color](./color/) | Represents an ARGB (alpha, red, green, blue) color. |
| [Point](./point/) | Represents an ordered pair of integer x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane. |
| [PointF](./pointf/) | Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane. |
| [Rectangle](./rectangle/) | Stores a set of four integers that represent the location and size of a rectangle. |
| [RectangleF](./rectanglef/) | Stores a set of four floating-point numbers that represent the location and size of a rectangle. For more advanced region functions, use a Region object. |
| [Size](./size/) | Stores an ordered pair of integers, typically the width and height of a rectangle. |
| [SizeF](./sizef/) | Stores an ordered pair of floating-point numbers, typically the width and height of a rectangle. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ContentAlignment](./contentalignment/) | Specifies alignment of content on the drawing surface. |
| [CopyPixelOperation](./copypixeloperation/) | Determines how the source color in a copy pixel operation is combined with the destination color to result in a final color. |
| [FontStyle](./fontstyle/) | Specifies style information applied to text. |
| [GraphicsUnit](./graphicsunit/) | Specifies the unit of measure for the given data. |
| [KnownColor](./knowncolor/) | Specifies the known system colors. |
| [RotateFlipType](./rotatefliptype/) | Specifies the direction of an image's rotation and the axis used to flip the image. |
| [StringAlignment](./stringalignment/) | Specifies the alignment of a text string relative to its layout rectangle. |
| [StringDigitSubstitute](./stringdigitsubstitute/) | The StringDigitSubstitute enumeration specifies how to substitute digits in a string according to a user's locale or language. |
| [StringFormatFlags](./stringformatflags/) | Specifies the display and layout information for text strings. |
| [StringTrimming](./stringtrimming/) | Specifies how to trim characters from a string that does not completely fit into a layout shape. |
