The Drawing namespace provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality. More advanced functionality is provided in the Drawing2D, Imaging, and Text namespaces.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [Bitmap](./bitmap) | Encapsulates a bitmap, which consists of the pixel data for a graphics image and its attributes. A [`Bitmap`](system.drawing/bitmap) is an object used to work with images defined by pixel data. |
| abstract class [Brush](./brush) | Defines objects used to fill the interiors of graphical shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths. |
| class [Brushes](./brushes) | Brushes for all the standard colors. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [ColorConverter](./colorconverter) | Converts colors from one data type to another. |
| static class [DrawingSettings](./drawingsettings) | Allows to adjust the behavior of the drawing library in case of using of some features that are not yet implemented completely. |
| class [Font](./font) | Defines a particular format for text, including font face, size, and style attributes. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [FontFamily](./fontfamily) | Defines a group of type faces having a similar basic design and certain variations in styles. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [Graphics](./graphics) | Encapsulates drawing surface. |
| class [Icon](./icon) | Represents a Windows icon, which is a small bitmap image that is used to represent an object. Icons can be thought of as transparent bitmaps, although their size is determined by the system. |
| abstract class [Image](./image) | An abstract base class that provides functionality for the Bitmap and Metafile descended classes. |
| static class [NamespaceDoc](./namespacedoc) | The Drawing namespace provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality. More advanced functionality is provided in the Drawing2D, Imaging, and Text namespaces. |
| class [Pen](./pen) | Defines an object used to draw lines and curves. |
| class [Pens](./pens) | Pens for all the standard colors. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [Region](./region) | Describes the interior of a graphics shape composed of rectangles and paths. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [SolidBrush](./solidbrush) | Defines a brush of a single color. Brushes are used to fill graphics shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths. |
| class [StringFormat](./stringformat) | Encapsulates text layout information (such as alignment, orientation and tab stops) display manipulations (such as ellipsis insertion and national digit substitution) and OpenType features. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [SystemColors](./systemcolors) | Each property of the SystemColors class is a Color structure that is the color of a Windows display element. |
| class [SystemFonts](./systemfonts) | Specifies the fonts used to display text in Windows display elements. |
| class [SystemIcons](./systemicons) | Each property of the SystemIcons class is an Icon object for Windows system-wide icons. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [TextureBrush](./texturebrush) | Each property of the TextureBrush class is a Brush object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enum [ContentAlignment](./contentalignment) | Specifies alignment of content on the drawing surface. |
| enum [CopyPixelOperation](./copypixeloperation) | Determines how the source color in a copy pixel operation is combined with the destination color to result in a final color. |
| enum [FontStyle](./fontstyle) | Specifies style information applied to text. |
| enum [GraphicsUnit](./graphicsunit) | Specifies the unit of measure for the given data. |
| enum [KnownColor](./knowncolor) | Specifies the known system colors. |
| enum [RotateFlipType](./rotatefliptype) | Specifies the direction of an image's rotation and the axis used to flip the image. |
| enum [StringAlignment](./stringalignment) | Specifies the alignment of a text string relative to its layout rectangle. |
| enum [StringDigitSubstitute](./stringdigitsubstitute) | The StringDigitSubstitute enumeration specifies how to substitute digits in a string according to a user's locale or language. |
| enum [StringFormatFlags](./stringformatflags) | Specifies the display and layout information for text strings. |
| enum [StringTrimming](./stringtrimming) | Specifies how to trim characters from a string that does not completely fit into a layout shape. |
