## Graphics.FillPolygon method (1 of 4)

Fills the interior of a polygon defined by an array of points specified by PointF structures using the specified fill mode.

```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | Brush that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of PointF structures that represent the vertices of the polygon to fill. |
| fillMode | FillMode | Member of the FillMode enumeration that determines the style of the fill. |
