## Graphics.DrawCurve method (1 of 7)

Draws a cardinal spline through a specified array of PointF structures.

```csharp
public void DrawCurve(Pen pen, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and style of the curve. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of PointF structures that define the spline. |

## Graphics.DrawCurve method (3 of 7)

Draws a cardinal spline through a specified array of Point structures using a specified tension.

```csharp
public void DrawCurve(Pen pen, Point[] points, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and style of the curve. |

## Graphics.DrawCurve method (4 of 7)

Draws a cardinal spline through a specified array of PointF structures using a specified tension. The drawing begins offset from the beginning of the array.

```csharp
public void DrawCurve(Pen pen, PointF[] points, int offset, int numberOfSegments)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and style of the curve. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of PointF structures that define the spline. |
| offset | Int32 | Offset from the first element in the array of the points parameter to the starting point in the curve. |
| numberOfSegments | Int32 | Number of segments after the starting point to include in the curve. |
