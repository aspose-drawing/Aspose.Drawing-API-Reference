## SizeF structure

Stores an ordered pair of floating-point numbers, typically the width and height of a rectangle.

```csharp
public struct SizeF : IEquatable<SizeF>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SizeF](sizef)(PointF) | Initializes a new instance of the [`SizeF`](../sizef) struct. |
| [SizeF](sizef)(SizeF) | Initializes a new instance of the [`SizeF`](../sizef) struct. |
| [SizeF](sizef)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the SizeF structure from the specified dimensions. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Height](../../system.drawing/sizef/height) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the vertical component of this SizeF structure. |
| [IsEmpty](../../system.drawing/sizef/isempty) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this SizeF structure has zero width and height. |
| [Width](../../system.drawing/sizef/width) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the horizontal component of this SizeF structure. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](../../system.drawing/sizef/add)(SizeF, SizeF) | Adds the width and height of one SizeF structure to the width and height of another SizeF structure. |
| static [Subtract](../../system.drawing/sizef/subtract)(SizeF, SizeF) | Subtracts the width and height of one SizeF structure from the width and height of another SizeF structure. |
| override [Equals](../../system.drawing/sizef/equals)(object) | Tests to see whether the specified object is a SizeF structure with the same dimensions as this SizeF structure. |
| [Equals](../../system.drawing/sizef/equals)(SizeF) | Tests whether other [`SizeF`](../sizef) structure has the same size of this [`SizeF`](../sizef) structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../system.drawing/sizef/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code for this SizeF structure. |
| [ToPointF](../../system.drawing/sizef/topointf)() | Converts a SizeF structure to a PointF structure. |
| [ToSize](../../system.drawing/sizef/tosize)() | Converts a SizeF structure to a Size structure. |
| override [ToString](../../system.drawing/sizef/tostring)() | Converts the attributes of this [`SizeF`](../sizef) to a human readable string. |
| [operator +](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_addition) | Adds the width and height of one SizeF structure to the width and height of another SizeF structure. |
| [operator /](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_division) | Divides [`SizeF`](../sizef) by a Single producing [`SizeF`](../sizef). |
| [operator ==](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_equality) | Tests whether two SizeF structures are equal. |
| [explicit operator](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_explicit) | Converts the specified [`SizeF`](../sizef) to a [`PointF`](../pointf). |
| [operator !=](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_inequality) | Tests whether two SizeF structures are different. |
| [operator *](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_multiply) | Multiplies [`SizeF`](../sizef) by a Single producing [`SizeF`](../sizef). (2 operators) |
| [operator -](../../system.drawing/sizef/op_subtraction) | Subtracts the width and height of one SizeF structure from the width and height of another SizeF structure. |

## Other Members

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [Empty](empty) | Gets a SizeF structure that has a Height and Width value of 0. |
