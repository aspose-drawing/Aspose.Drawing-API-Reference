## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromArgb](../../system.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb)(int) | Creates a Color structure from a 32-bit ARGB value. |
| static [FromArgb](../../system.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_3)(int, Color) | Creates a Color structure from the specified Color structure, but with the new specified alpha value. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for the alpha value, the value is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../system.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_1)(int, int, int) | Creates a Color structure from the specified 8-bit color values (red, green, and blue). The alpha value is implicitly 255 (fully opaque). Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each color component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../system.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_2)(int, int, int, int) | Creates a Color structure from the four ARGB component (alpha, red, green, and blue) values. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromKnownColor](../../system.drawing/color/fromknowncolor/)(KnownColor) | Creates a Color structure from the specified predefined color. |
| static [FromName](../../system.drawing/color/fromname/)(string) | Creates a Color structure from the specified name of a predefined color. |
| [Equals](../../system.drawing/color/equals/#equals)(Color) | Tests whether the specified color is equivalent to this color. |
| override [Equals](../../system.drawing/color/equals/#equals_1)(object) | Tests whether the specified object is equivalent to this color. |
| [GetBrightness](../../system.drawing/color/getbrightness/)() | Gets the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) brightness value for this Color structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../system.drawing/color/gethashcode/)() | Returns a hash code for this instance. |
| [GetHue](../../system.drawing/color/gethue/)() | Gets the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) hue value, in degrees, for this Color structure. |
| [GetSaturation](../../system.drawing/color/getsaturation/)() | Gets the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) saturation value for this Color structure. |
| [ToArgb](../../system.drawing/color/toargb/)() | Gets the 32-bit ARGB value of this Color structure. |
| [ToKnownColor](../../system.drawing/color/toknowncolor/)() | Gets the [`KnownColor`](../knowncolor/) value of this Color structure. |
| override [ToString](../../system.drawing/color/tostring/)() | Returns a String that represents this instance. |
| [operator ==](../../system.drawing/color/op_equality/) | Tests whether two specified Color structures are equivalent. |
| [operator !=](../../system.drawing/color/op_inequality/) | Tests whether two specified Color structures are different. |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
