## Point structure

Represents an ordered pair of integer x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

```csharp
public struct Point : IEquatable<Point>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Point](point)(int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) struct using coordinates specified by an integer value. |
| [Point](point)(Size) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) struct from a [`Size`](../size) . |
| [Point](point)(int, int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](../point) struct with the specified coordinates. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsEmpty](../../system.drawing/point/isempty) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this this Point is empty. |
| [X](../../system.drawing/point/x) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this Point. |
| [Y](../../system.drawing/point/y) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this Point. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](../../system.drawing/point/add)(Point, Size) | Adds the specified Size to the specified Point. |
| static [Ceiling](../../system.drawing/point/ceiling)(PointF) | Converts a [`PointF`](../pointf) to a [`Point`](../point) by performing a ceiling operation on all the coordinates. |
| static [Round](../../system.drawing/point/round)(PointF) | Converts the specified PointF to a Point object by rounding the Point values to the nearest integer. |
| static [Subtract](../../system.drawing/point/subtract)(Point, Size) | Translates a [`Point`](../point) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size) . |
| static [Truncate](../../system.drawing/point/truncate)(PointF) | Converts a PointF to a Point by performing a truncate operation on all the coordinates. |
| override [Equals](../../system.drawing/point/equals)(object) | Specifies whether this Point contains the same coordinates as the specified Object. |
| [Equals](../../system.drawing/point/equals)(Point) | Tests whether other [`Point`](../point) structure has the same location of this [`Point`](../point) structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../system.drawing/point/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code for this Point. |
| [Offset](../../system.drawing/point/offset)(Point) | Translates this Point by the specified Point. |
| [Offset](../../system.drawing/point/offset)(int, int) | Translates this Point by the specified amount. |
| override [ToString](../../system.drawing/point/tostring)() | Converts the attributes of this [`Point`](../point) to a human readable string. |
| [operator +](../../system.drawing/point/op_addition) | Translates a [`Point`](../point) by a given [`Size`](../size) . |
| [operator ==](../../system.drawing/point/op_equality) | Compares two Point objects. The result specifies whether the values of the X and Y properties of the two Point objects are equal. |
| [explicit operator](../../system.drawing/point/op_explicit) | Creates a [`Size`](../size) with the coordinates of the specified [`Point`](../point). |
| [implicit operator](../../system.drawing/point/op_implicit) | Converts the specified Point structure to a PointF structure. |
| [operator !=](../../system.drawing/point/op_inequality) | Compares two Point objects. The result specifies whether the values of the X or Y properties of the two Point objects are unequal. |
| [operator -](../../system.drawing/point/op_subtraction) | Translates a [`Point`](../point) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size) . |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [Empty](../../system.drawing/point/empty) | Represents a Point that has X and Y values set to zero. |
