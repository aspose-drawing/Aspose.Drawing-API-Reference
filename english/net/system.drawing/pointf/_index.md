## PointF structure

Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

```csharp
public struct PointF : IEquatable<PointF>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PointF](pointf)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the PointF structure with the specified coordinates. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsEmpty](../../system.drawing/pointf/isempty) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this PointF is empty. |
| [X](../../system.drawing/pointf/x) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this PointF. |
| [Y](../../system.drawing/pointf/y) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this PointF. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](../../system.drawing/pointf/add)(PointF, Size) | Translates a given PointF by a specified SizeF. |
| static [Add](../../system.drawing/pointf/add)(PointF, SizeF) | Translates a given PointF by a specified SizeF. |
| static [Subtract](../../system.drawing/pointf/subtract)(PointF, Size) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size) . |
| static [Subtract](../../system.drawing/pointf/subtract)(PointF, SizeF) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size) . |
| override [Equals](../../system.drawing/pointf/equals)(object) | Specifies whether this PointF contains the same coordinates as the specified Object. |
| [Equals](../../system.drawing/pointf/equals)(PointF) | Tests whether other [`PointF`](../pointf) structure has the same location of this [`PointF`](../pointf) structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../system.drawing/pointf/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code for this instance. |
| override [ToString](../../system.drawing/pointf/tostring)() | Converts the attributes of this [`PointF`](../pointf) to a human readable string. |
| [operator +](../../system.drawing/pointf/op_addition) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by a given [`Size`](../size) . (2 operators) |
| [operator ==](../../system.drawing/pointf/op_equality) | Compares two PointF structures. The result specifies whether the values of the X and Y properties of the two PointF structures are equal. |
| [operator !=](../../system.drawing/pointf/op_inequality) | Determines whether the coordinates of the specified points are not equal. |
| [operator -](../../system.drawing/pointf/op_subtraction) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size) . (2 operators) |

## Other Members

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [Empty](empty) | Represents a new instance of the PointF class with member data left uninitialized. |
