## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AdjustableArrowCap](./adjustablearrowcap/) | Represents an adjustable arrow-shaped line cap. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Blend](./blend/) | Defines a blend pattern for a LinearGradientBrush object. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [ColorBlend](./colorblend/) | Defines arrays of colors and positions used for interpolating color blending in a multicolor gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [CustomLineCap](./customlinecap/) | Encapsulates a custom user-defined line cap. |
| [GraphicsContainer](./graphicscontainer/) | Represents the internal data of a graphics container. This class is used when saving the state of a Graphics object using the BeginContainer and EndContainer methods. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [GraphicsPath](./graphicspath/) | Represents a series of connected lines and curves. |
| [GraphicsPathIterator](./graphicspathiterator/) | Provides the ability to iterate through subpaths in a GraphicsPath and test the types of shapes contained in each subpath. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [GraphicsState](./graphicsstate/) | Represents the state of a [`Graphics`](../aspose.drawing/graphics/) object. This object is returned by a call to the Save methods. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [HatchBrush](./hatchbrush/) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a Brush with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Matrix](./matrix/) | Encapsulates a 3-by-3 affine matrix that represents a geometric transform. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathData](./pathdata/) | Contains the graphical data that makes up a GraphicsPath object. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrush](./pathgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a Brush object that fills the interior of a GraphicsPath object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [RegionData](./regiondata/) | Encapsulates the data that makes up a Region object. This class cannot be inherited. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CombineMode](./combinemode/) | Specifies how different clipping regions can be combined. |
| [CompositingMode](./compositingmode/) | Specifies how the source colors are combined with the background colors. |
| [CompositingQuality](./compositingquality/) | Specifies the quality level to use during compositing. |
| [CoordinateSpace](./coordinatespace/) | Specifies the system to use when evaluating coordinates. |
| [DashCap](./dashcap/) | Specifies the type of graphic shape to use on both ends of each dash in a dashed line. |
| [DashStyle](./dashstyle/) | Specifies the style of dashed lines drawn with a Pen object. |
| [FillMode](./fillmode/) | Specifies how the interior of a closed path is filled. |
| [FlushIntention](./flushintention/) | Specifies whether commands in the graphics stack are terminated (flushed) immediately or executed as soon as possible. |
| [HatchStyle](./hatchstyle/) | Specifies the different patterns available for HatchBrush objects. |
| [InterpolationMode](./interpolationmode/) | The InterpolationMode enumeration specifies the algorithm that is used when images are scaled or rotated. |
| [LinearGradientMode](./lineargradientmode/) | Specifies the direction of a linear gradient. |
| [LineCap](./linecap/) | Specifies the available cap styles with which a Pen object can end a line. |
| [LineJoin](./linejoin/) | Specifies how to join consecutive line or curve segments in a figure (subpath) contained in a GraphicsPath object. |
| [MatrixOrder](./matrixorder/) | Specifies the order for matrix transform operations. |
| [PathPointType](./pathpointtype/) | Specifies the type of point in a GraphicsPath object. |
| [PenAlignment](./penalignment/) | Specifies the alignment of a Pen object in relation to the theoretical, zero-width line. |
| [PenType](./pentype/) | Specifies the type of fill a Pen object uses to fill lines. |
| [PixelOffsetMode](./pixeloffsetmode/) | Specifies how pixels are offset during rendering. |
| [SmoothingMode](./smoothingmode/) | Specifies whether smoothing (antialiasing) is applied to lines and curves and the edges of filled areas. |
| [WarpMode](./warpmode/) | Specifies the type of warp transformation applied in a Warp method. |
| [WrapMode](./wrapmode/) | Specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
