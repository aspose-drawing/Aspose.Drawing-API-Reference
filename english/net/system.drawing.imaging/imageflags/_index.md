## ImageFlags enumeration

Specifies the attributes of the pixel data contained in an [`Image`](../../system.drawing/image) object. The Flags property returns a member of this enumeration. This enumeration has a FlagsAttribute attribute that allows a bitwise combination of its member values.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum ImageFlags
```
