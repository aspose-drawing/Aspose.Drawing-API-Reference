## GraphicsPath.AddClosedCurve method (1 of 2)

Adds a closed curve to this path. A cardinal spline curve is used because the curve travels through each of the points in the array.

```csharp
public void AddClosedCurve(PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | An array of PointF structures that represents the points that define the curve. |

* class [GraphicsPath](../../graphicspath)
* namespace [System.Drawing.Drawing2D](../../graphicspath)

## GraphicsPath.AddClosedCurve method (2 of 2)

Adds a closed curve to this path. A cardinal spline curve is used because the curve travels through each of the points in the array.

```csharp
public void AddClosedCurve(PointF[] points, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | An array of PointF structures that represents the points that define the curve. |
| tension | Single | A value between from 0 through 1 that specifies the amount that the curve bends between points, with 0 being the smallest curve (sharpest corner) and 1 being the smoothest curve. |
