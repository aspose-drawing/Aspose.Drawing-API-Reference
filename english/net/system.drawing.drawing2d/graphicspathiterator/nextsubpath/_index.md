## GraphicsPathIterator.NextSubpath method (1 of 2)

Moves the [`GraphicsPathIterator`](../../graphicspathiterator) to the next subpath in the path. The start index and end index of the next subpath are contained in the [out] parameters.

```csharp
public int NextSubpath(out int startIndex, out int endIndex, out bool isClosed)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startIndex | Int32& | [out] Receives the starting index of the next subpath. |
| endIndex | Int32& | [out] Receives the ending index of the next subpath. |
| isClosed | Boolean& | [out] Indicates whether the subpath is closed. |

## Return Value

The number of data points in the retrieved figure (subpath). If there are no more figures to retrieve, zero is returned.

```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | GraphicsPath | A [`GraphicsPath`](../../graphicspath) that is to have its data points set to match the data points of the retrieved figure (subpath) for this iterator. |
| isClosed | Boolean& | [out] Indicates whether the current subpath is closed. It is true if the if the figure is closed, otherwise it is false. |

## Return Value
