## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [AdjustableArrowCap](./adjustablearrowcap) | Represents an adjustable arrow-shaped line cap. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [Blend](./blend) | Defines a blend pattern for a LinearGradientBrush object. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [ColorBlend](./colorblend) | Defines arrays of colors and positions used for interpolating color blending in a multicolor gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [CustomLineCap](./customlinecap) | Encapsulates a custom user-defined line cap. |
| class [GraphicsContainer](./graphicscontainer) | Represents the internal data of a graphics container. This class is used when saving the state of a Graphics object using the BeginContainer and EndContainer methods. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [GraphicsPath](./graphicspath) | Represents a series of connected lines and curves. |
| class [GraphicsPathIterator](./graphicspathiterator) | Provides the ability to iterate through subpaths in a GraphicsPath and test the types of shapes contained in each subpath. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [GraphicsState](./graphicsstate) | Represents the state of a [`Graphics`](system.drawing/graphics) object. This object is returned by a call to the Save methods. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [HatchBrush](./hatchbrush) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush) | Encapsulates a Brush with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [Matrix](./matrix) | Encapsulates a 3-by-3 affine matrix that represents a geometric transform. This class cannot be inherited. |
| static class [NamespaceDoc](./namespacedoc) | The Drawing2D namespace provides advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality. |
| class [PathData](./pathdata) | Contains the graphical data that makes up a GraphicsPath object. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [PathGradientBrush](./pathgradientbrush) | Encapsulates a Brush object that fills the interior of a GraphicsPath object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [RegionData](./regiondata) | Encapsulates the data that makes up a Region object. This class cannot be inherited. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enum [CombineMode](./combinemode) | Specifies how different clipping regions can be combined. |
| enum [CompositingMode](./compositingmode) | Specifies how the source colors are combined with the background colors. |
| enum [CompositingQuality](./compositingquality) | Specifies the quality level to use during compositing. |
| enum [CoordinateSpace](./coordinatespace) | Specifies the system to use when evaluating coordinates. |
| enum [DashCap](./dashcap) | Specifies the type of graphic shape to use on both ends of each dash in a dashed line. |
| enum [DashStyle](./dashstyle) | Specifies the style of dashed lines drawn with a Pen object. |
| enum [FillMode](./fillmode) | Specifies how the interior of a closed path is filled. |
| enum [FlushIntention](./flushintention) | Specifies whether commands in the graphics stack are terminated (flushed) immediately or executed as soon as possible. |
| enum [HatchStyle](./hatchstyle) | Specifies the different patterns available for HatchBrush objects. |
| enum [InterpolationMode](./interpolationmode) | The InterpolationMode enumeration specifies the algorithm that is used when images are scaled or rotated. |
| enum [LinearGradientMode](./lineargradientmode) | Specifies the direction of a linear gradient. |
| enum [LineCap](./linecap) | Specifies the available cap styles with which a Pen object can end a line. |
| enum [LineJoin](./linejoin) | Specifies how to join consecutive line or curve segments in a figure (subpath) contained in a GraphicsPath object. |
| enum [MatrixOrder](./matrixorder) | Specifies the order for matrix transform operations. |
| enum [PathPointType](./pathpointtype) | Specifies the type of point in a GraphicsPath object. |
| enum [PenAlignment](./penalignment) | Specifies the alignment of a Pen object in relation to the theoretical, zero-width line. |
| enum [PenType](./pentype) | Specifies the type of fill a Pen object uses to fill lines. |
| enum [PixelOffsetMode](./pixeloffsetmode) | Specifies how pixels are offset during rendering. |
| enum [SmoothingMode](./smoothingmode) | Specifies whether smoothing (antialiasing) is applied to lines and curves and the edges of filled areas. |
| enum [WarpMode](./warpmode) | Specifies the type of warp transformation applied in a Warp method. |
| enum [WrapMode](./wrapmode) | Specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
