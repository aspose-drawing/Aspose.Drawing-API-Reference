## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb)(int) | Creates a Color structure from a 32-bit ARGB value. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_1)(int, Color) | Creates a Color structure from the specified Color structure, but with the new specified alpha value. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for the alpha value, the value is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_2)(int, int, int) | Creates a Color structure from the specified 8-bit color values (red, green, and blue). The alpha value is implicitly 255 (fully opaque). Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each color component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_3)(int, int, int, int) | Creates a Color structure from the four ARGB component (alpha, red, green, and blue) values. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromKnownColor](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromknowncolor/)(KnownColor) | Creates a Color structure from the specified predefined color. |
| static [FromName](../../aspose.drawing/color/fromname/)(string) | Creates a Color structure from the specified name of a predefined color. |
| [Equals](../../aspose.drawing/color/equals/#equals)(Color) | Tests whether the specified color is equivalent to this color. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.drawing/color/equals/#equals_1)(object) | Tests whether the specified object is equivalent to this color. |
| [GetBrightness](../../aspose.drawing/color/getbrightness/)() | Gets the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) brightness value for this Color structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.drawing/color/gethashcode/)() | Returns a hash code for this instance. |
| [GetHue](../../aspose.drawing/color/gethue/)() | Gets the hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) hue value, in degrees, for this Color structure. |
