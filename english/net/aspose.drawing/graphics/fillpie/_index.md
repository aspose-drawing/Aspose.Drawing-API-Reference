## FillPie(Brush, Rectangle, float, float) {#fillpie}

Fills the interior of a pie section defined by an ellipse specified by a Rectangle structure and two radial lines.

```csharp
public void FillPie(Brush brush, Rectangle rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | Brush that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| rect | Rectangle | Rectangle structure that represents the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the first side of the pie section. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the startAngle parameter to the second side of the pie section. |

## FillPie(Brush, float, float, float, float, float, float) {#fillpie_2}

Fills the interior of a pie section defined by an ellipse specified by a pair of coordinates, a width, a height, and two radial lines.

```csharp
public void FillPie(Brush brush, float x, float y, float width, float height, float startAngle, 
    float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | Brush that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| width | Single | Width of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| height | Single | Height of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie section comes. |
| startAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the first side of the pie section. |
| sweepAngle | Single | Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the startAngle parameter to the second side of the pie section. |
