## DrawClosedCurve(Pen, PointF[], float, FillMode) {#drawclosedcurve_1}

Draws a closed cardinal spline defined by an array of PointF structures using a specified tension.

```csharp
public void DrawClosedCurve(Pen pen, PointF[] points, float tension, FillMode fillmode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and height of the curve. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of PointF structures that define the spline. |
| tension | Single | Value greater than or equal to 0.0F that specifies the tension of the curve. |
| fillmode | FillMode | Member of the FillMode enumeration that determines how the curve is filled. This parameter is required but is ignored. |
