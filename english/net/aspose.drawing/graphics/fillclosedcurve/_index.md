## FillClosedCurve(Brush, PointF[], FillMode, float) {#fillclosedcurve_2}

Fills the interior of a closed cardinal spline curve defined by an array of PointF structures using the specified fill mode and tension.

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillmode, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | A Brush that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of PointF structures that define the spline. |
| fillmode | FillMode | Member of the FillMode enumeration that determines how the curve is filled. |
| tension | Single | Value greater than or equal to 0.0F that specifies the tension of the curve. |
