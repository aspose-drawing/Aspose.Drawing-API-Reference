## DrawBezier(Pen, PointF, PointF, PointF, PointF) {#drawbezier}

Draws a Bézier spline defined by four PointF structures.

```csharp
public void DrawBezier(Pen pen, PointF pt1, PointF pt2, PointF pt3, PointF pt4)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and style of the curve. |
| pt1 | PointF | PointF structure that represents the starting point of the curve. |
| pt2 | PointF | PointF structure that represents the first control point for the curve. |
| pt3 | PointF | PointF structure that represents the second control point for the curve. |
| pt4 | PointF | PointF structure that represents the ending point of the curve. |

## DrawBezier(Pen, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float) {#drawbezier_1}

Draws a Bézier spline defined by four ordered pairs of coordinates that represent points.

```csharp
public void DrawBezier(Pen pen, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3, 
    float x4, float y4)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | Pen that determines the color, width, and style of the curve. |
| x1 | Single | The x-coordinate of the starting point of the curve. |
| y1 | Single | The y-coordinate of the starting point of the curve. |
| x2 | Single | The x-coordinate of the first control point of the curve. |
| y2 | Single | The y-coordinate of the first control point of the curve. |
| x3 | Single | The x-coordinate of the second control point of the curve. |
| y3 | Single | The y-coordinate of the second control point of the curve. |
| x4 | Single | The x-coordinate of the ending point of the curve. |
| y4 | Single | The y-coordinate of the ending point of the curve. |
