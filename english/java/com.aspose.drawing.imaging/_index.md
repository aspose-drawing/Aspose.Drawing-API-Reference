## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BitmapData](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata) | Specifies the attributes of a bitmap image. |
| [ColorAdjustType](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/coloradjusttype) | Specifies which GDI+ objects use color adjustment information. |
| [ColorChannelFlag](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/colorchannelflag) | Specifies individual channels in the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) color space. |
| [ColorMap](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/colormap) | Defines a map for converting colors. |
| [ColorMatrix](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/colormatrix) | Defines a 5 x 5 matrix that contains the coordinates for the RGBA space. |
| [ColorMatrixFlag](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/colormatrixflag) | Specifies the types of images and colors that will be affected by the color and grayscale adjustment settings of an [ImageAttributes](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imageattributes). |
| [ColorPalette](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/colorpalette) | Defines an array of colors that make up a color palette. |
| [EmfPlusRecordType](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/emfplusrecordtype) | Specifies the methods available for use with a metafile to read and write graphic commands. |
| [EmfType](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/emftype) | Specifies the nature of the records that are placed in an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) file. |
| [Encoder](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encoder) | An [Encoder](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encoder) object encapsulates a globally unique identifier (GUID) that identifies the category of an image encoder parameter. |
| [EncoderParameter](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encoderparameter) | Used to pass a value, or an array of values, to an image encoder. |
| [EncoderParameters](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encoderparameters) | Encapsulates an array of [EncoderParameter](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encoderparameter) objects. |
| [EncoderValue](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/encodervalue) | Used to specify the parameter value passed to a JPEG or TIFF image encoder when using the `M:Image.Save(System.String,System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo,System.Drawing.Imaging.EncoderParameters)` or `M:Image.SaveAdd(System.Drawing.Imaging.EncoderParameters)` methods. |
| [FrameDimension](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/framedimension) | Provides properties that get the frame dimensions of an image. |
| [ImageAttributes](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imageattributes) | Contains information about how bitmap and metafile colors are manipulated during rendering. |
| [ImageCodecInfo](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imagecodecinfo) | The [ImageCodecInfo](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imagecodecinfo) class provides the necessary storage members and methods to retrieve all pertinent information about the installed image encoders and decoders (called codecs). |
| [ImageFlags](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imageflags) | Specifies the attributes of the pixel data contained in an [Image](../com.aspose.drawing/image) object. |
| [ImageFormat](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imageformat) | Specifies the file format of the image. |
| [ImageLockMode](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/imagelockmode) | Specifies flags that are passed to the flags parameter of the [Bitmap.\#lockBits(Rectangle, int, int)](../com.aspose.drawing/bitmap\#lockBits-Rectangle--int--int-) method. |
| [MetaHeader](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metaheader) | Contains information about a windows-format (WMF) metafile. |
| [Metafile](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metafile) | Defines a graphic metafile. |
| [MetafileFrameUnit](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metafileframeunit) | Specifies the unit of measurement for the rectangle used to size and position a metafile. |
| [MetafileHeader](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metafileheader) | Contains attributes of an associated [Metafile](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metafile). |
| [MetafileType](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/metafiletype) | Specifies types of metafiles. |
| [PixelFormat](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/pixelformat) | Specifies the format of the color data for each pixel in the image. |
| [PlayRecordCallback](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/playrecordcallback) | This delegate is not used. |
| [PropertyItem](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/propertyitem) | Encapsulates a metadata property to be included in an image file. |
| [WmfPlaceableFileHeader](../com.aspose.drawing.imaging/wmfplaceablefileheader) | Defines a placeable metafile. |
