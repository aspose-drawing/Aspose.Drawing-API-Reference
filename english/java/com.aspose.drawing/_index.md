Aspose.Drawing is a graphics API that provides the capability of 2D drawings identical to GDI+ in your .NET applications.


## Classes

| Class | Description |

| [ColorConverter](../com.aspose.drawing/colorconverter) | Converts colors from one data type to another. |
| [ColorTranslator](../com.aspose.drawing/colortranslator) | Translates colors to and from GDI+ [Color](../com.aspose.drawing/color) structures. |
| [ContentAlignment](../com.aspose.drawing/contentalignment) | Specifies alignment of content on the drawing surface. |
| [CopyPixelOperation](../com.aspose.drawing/copypixeloperation) | Determines how the source color in a copy pixel operation is combined with the destination color to result in a final color. |
| [DrawingSettings](../com.aspose.drawing/drawingsettings) | Allows to adjust the behavior of the drawing library in case of using of some features that are not yet implemented completely. |
| [Font](../com.aspose.drawing/font) | Defines a particular format for text, including font face, size, and style attributes. |
| [FontCollection](../com.aspose.drawing/fontcollection) | Provides a base class for installed and private font collections. |

| [GraphicsUnit](../com.aspose.drawing/graphicsunit) | Specifies the unit of measure for the given data. |
| [Icon](../com.aspose.drawing/icon) | Represents a Windows icon, which is a small bitmap image that is used to represent an object. |
| [Image](../com.aspose.drawing/image) | An abstract base class that provides functionality for the Bitmap and Metafile descended classes. |
| [Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort](../com.aspose.drawing/image.getthumbnailimageabort) | Provides a callback method for determining when the [.\#getThumbnailImage(int, int, GetThumbnailImageAbort, IntPtr)](../null/\#getThumbnailImage-int--int--GetThumbnailImageAbort--IntPtr-) method should prematurely cancel execution. |
| [KnownColor](../com.aspose.drawing/knowncolor) | Specifies the known system colors. |
| [License](../com.aspose.drawing/license) | Provides methods to license the component. |

| [Pens](../com.aspose.drawing/pens) | Pens for all the standard colors. |
| [Point](../com.aspose.drawing/point) | Represents an ordered pair of integer x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane. |
| [PointF](../com.aspose.drawing/pointf) | Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane. |
| [Rectangle](../com.aspose.drawing/rectangle) | Stores a set of four integers that represent the location and size of a rectangle. |
| [RectangleF](../com.aspose.drawing/rectanglef) | Stores a set of four floating-point numbers that represent the location and size of a rectangle. |

| [RotateFlipType](../com.aspose.drawing/rotatefliptype) | Specifies the direction of an image's rotation and the axis used to flip the image. |
| [Size](../com.aspose.drawing/size) | Stores an ordered pair of integers, typically the width and height of a rectangle. |
| [SizeF](../com.aspose.drawing/sizef) | Stores an ordered pair of floating-point numbers, typically the width and height of a rectangle. |
| [SolidBrush](../com.aspose.drawing/solidbrush) | Defines a brush of a single color. |
| [StringAlignment](../com.aspose.drawing/stringalignment) | Specifies the alignment of a text string relative to its layout rectangle. |
| [StringDigitSubstitute](../com.aspose.drawing/stringdigitsubstitute) | The [StringDigitSubstitute](../com.aspose.drawing/stringdigitsubstitute) enumeration specifies how to substitute digits in a string according to a user's locale or language. |
| [StringFormat](../com.aspose.drawing/stringformat) | Encapsulates text layout information (such as alignment, orientation and tab stops) display manipulations (such as ellipsis insertion and national digit substitution) and OpenType features. |
